# Welcome

Hi, i am really happy that we can work together on this workshops. This repository will be the main playground for our learning for next two days. We have a lot of discussions, tasks and knowledge ahead of us. Don't be afraid to ask anything. Please be open to ask, think and work. 

Repository is splitted into three directories: 

- playground - place for you
- solutions - place for me
- materials - tasks and presentation
